# world-value-survey-segmentation
This project segments socioeconomic groups using World Values Survey (Wave 7) data (90,000+ records). After preprocessing, MiniBatch K-Means identifies four clusters, achieving a silhouette score of 0.120 and Davies-Bouldin index of 1.539, outperforming DBSCAN.

PCA (72% variance) and t-SNE reveal distinct groups: "Rural Poor" (avg. income $4,000), "Urban Middle Class" ($18,000), and "Elite" ($45,000), with education levels following the same trend. Compared to global benchmarks, Kazakhstanâ€™s middle class lags in income and education.

This study shows unsupervised learning effectively uncovers socioeconomic patterns, offering insights for policy, market research, and social planning.
